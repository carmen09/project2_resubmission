        In life, the number of beginnings is exactly equal to the number of
        endings: no one has yet to begin a life who will not end it. In poetry,
        the number of beginnings so far exceeds the number of endings that we
        cannot even conceive of it. Not every poem is finished—one poem is
        abandoned, another catches fire and is carried away by the wind, which
        may be an ending, but it is the ending of a poem without an end. <br /><br />
        Paul Valéry, the French poet and thinker, once said that
        <span class="big"
          >no poem is ever ended, that every poem is merely abandoned.</span
        >
        This saying is also attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for where
        quotations begin is in a cloud. <br /><br />
        Paul Valéry also described his perception of first lines so vividly, and
        to my mind so accurately,
        <span class="big">
          that I have never forgotten it: the opening line of a poem, he said,
          is like finding a fruit on the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you
          have never seen before, and the poet’s task is to create the tre from
          which such a fruit would fall.</span
        ><br /><br />
        <span class="big"> In the beginning was the Word. </span>Western
        civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of
        thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that nothing can
        precede action—no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive
        love before some kind of act. I believe the poem is an act of the mind.
        I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk
        about its beginning. Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins
        off the page, it begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a
        poem, often against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem
        gets written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run
        out of ice, and it's your house.
