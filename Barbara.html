            The poem is the consequence of its origins.   <span class="hidding"> Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant it and
            watch grow the tree from which it fell.</span>
<br><br>
            Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure:   <span class="hidding"> A Study of How Poems End,</span> says this: “Perhaps all we can
            say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension seem to be involved in all
            our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also
            released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent that those
            expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”
<br><br>
            But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin be traced when there is
            no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go
            back to a nanosecond before the beginning, before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the
            precise beginning because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before “knowing” itself
            was born.
            <br><br>
            <span class="hidding">  I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across ages, across cultures,
            across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that </span>first lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and
            that last lines are remarkably similar, even repeated. <span class="hidding"
            >Of course in all cases they remain remarkably
            distinct, because the words belong to completely different poems. And i began to realize, reading these
            first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last lines of the lifelong sentence we each
            speak but also the first and last lines of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those
            we listen to.</span> And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same: in poem after
            poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children
            repeated night after night,<span class="hidding"
            > like a refrain: </span>I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep
            now.   <span class="hidding"> And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on
            earth:</span> I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now.
            <br><br>
          <span class="hidding"> But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. Among Emily Dickinson’s last words (in a
            letter). A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, cloistered, spoke as if she had been out,
            exploring the earth, her whole life, and it was finally time to go in. And it was.</span>
