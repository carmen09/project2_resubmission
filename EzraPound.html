        >Now here is something really interesting (to me), something you can use
        at a standing-up-only party when everyone is tired of hearing there are
        one million three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five words used by the
        Esimo for snow. This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: </span
      >Some languages are so constructed—English among them—that we each only
      really speak one sentence in our lifetime.
      <span class="hidding"
        >That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around the
        kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the
        limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on
        hand. Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you
        and loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.</span
      >
      <br /><br />
   <span class="hidding"
         >   When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: </span>“That’s a lot
      of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; the sentence would be unwieldy and
      awkward and resemble the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a
      semicolon<span class="hidding"
        > (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation in all
      of poetry) </span>you should stop and be thankful that there exists this little
      thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that
      allows us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent
      purposes is unrelated. <br /><br />
      You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the
      first line to the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is
      to fly apart. <span class="hidding"
        >Between the first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if
      it were not for the poem that intervenes, the first and last lines of a
      poem would not speak to each other. </span><br /><br />
      Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to
      each other, not you to them or they to you. <br /><br />
      I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge
      scrolled words come on the screen and say: The End. I miss finishing a
      novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last
      words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling The End.
      <br /><br />
     <span class="hidding"
         >   It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only
       silently, with a deep sense of </span>feeling<span class="hidding"
                                                          >  : both the</span> feeling <span class="hidding"
         >  of being replete,
      a </span>feeling <span class="hidding"
                             >  of satisfaction, and the</span> feeling <span class="hidding"
         >  of loss, the sadness of having
      finished the book.</span> <br /><br />
      I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End.
      Why is that, I wonder. <span class="hidding"
         >  I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to
      novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy,
      no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line. And then I
      found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth
      grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink, beautifully apart from
      the rest of the text, were the words </span>The End. <span class="hidding"
         >  And I realized children very
      often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to
      have written anything, and they are completely unaware of the number of
      stories and poems that have already been written; they know some, of
      course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the
      only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and
      stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing.</span>
