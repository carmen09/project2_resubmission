        <span class="big"> I believe the poem is an act of the mind. </span>I think it is easier to talk
            about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning.
            Because the poem ends on the page, but it begins off the page, it
            begins in the mind. The mind acts, the mind wills a poem, often
            against our own will; somehow this happens, somehow a poem gets
            written in the middle of a chaotic holiday party that has just run out
            of ice, and it's your house. <br />
            <br /> 
            <span class="big">An act of the mind.</span> To move, to make happen, to make manifest.
            Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than
            possibility. And poets love possibility! They love to wonder and
            explore. Hard lot! But the poem, no matter how full of possibility,
            has to exist! To conduct oneself, to behave. How a poem acts marks its
            individual character. A poem by Glandolyn Blue does not sound like a
            poem by Timothy Sure. to pretend, feign, impersonate. That, too, yes
            and always, because self-consciousness is its own pretension, and has
            been from its beginning; the human mind is capable of a great elastic
            theatre. As the poet Ralph Angel</a>
       puts it,<span class="big"> “The poem is an
            interpretation of weird theatrical shit.”</span> the weird theatrical shit is
            what goes on around us every day of our lives; an animal of only
            instinct, Johnny Ferret, has in his actions drama, but no theater;
            theater requires that you draw a circle around the action and observe
            it from outside the circle; in other words, self-consciousness is
            theatre. <br /><br />Everyone knows that if you query poets about how
            their poems begin, the answer is always the same: a phrase, a line, a
            scrap of language, a rhythm, an image, something seen, heard,
            witnessed, or imagined. And the lesson is always the same, and young
            poets recognize this to be one of the most important lessons they can
            learn: if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent, you
            are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, at the top of a cliff you
            haven’t even climbed. This is a lesson that can only be learned by
            trial and error. <br /><br />
           <span class="big">  I believe many fine poems begin with ideas, but if you tell too many
             faces this, or tell it too loudly, they will get the wrong idea.</span>
