        Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct and astonishing thing: <span class="color"
        >We
      begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment. </span>The
      moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and
      fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the
      onset of disappointment and its dignification; the least we can do is
      dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through
      familiarization, by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize
      it, think about it.<br><br>
      I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one
      try inevitable thing. And if you believe that, then you are conceding that
      in the beginning was the act, not the word. The painter Cy Twombly quotes
      John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: <span class="color"
        >“The image cannot be disposed of a
      primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.” </span>Easy and appropriate
      thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his drawings
      and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have
      written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in
      Twombly’s work. <br><br>
      Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: <span class="color"
        >origins
      (beginnings) have consequences (endings).</span>
